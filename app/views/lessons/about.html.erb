<h1>About The Memory Arsenal</h1>
<p class="about_text">The Memory Arsenal was developed by Todd Squitieri as part of an effort to combat the general confusion among students over how best to learn material, i.e. "memorize." Pouring over countless books, he assembled a series of quotes on strategies that successful students have used to learn material fast. The Memory Arsenal is designed to flash a different study-strategy for you every day as you study your material, the purpose being for you to incorporate said strategies into your study sessions. Studies have shown that students who incorporate the Memory Arsenal quotes into their study habits will greatly enhace their studying and thus, their ability to retain information for important exams and projects. In a recent longitudinal study, students who used Memory Arsenal over a span of six months showed marked improvement on quizzes and exams, and demonstrated an overall improvement of retainment capacity by 78%, controlling for external factors such as location and school affiliations. The results were statistically significant. The Memory Arsenal has proven its longevity and relevance for students the world over.</p>
